# Diversity of DEI committees across international learned societies in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 

**Our mission statement:** *Making DEI structures more equitable and open.* 🌟

## 🔖 Background   
Learned societies lead and support researchers from around the world. They are often at the forefront of culture change in the research community. However, they can also unintentionally entrench and propagate existing biases in academia. For example,  members of traditionally underrepresented and marginalised groups may be subject to a ‘minority tax’ when they are tasked with fixing the system which has been set up by people with extreme privilege. Such roles are often associate wth DEI committees, or similar structures (e.g. DIE officers). However, currently there only exists anecdotal evidence on the composition of DEI structures in terms of gender and other characteristics that could be interpreted as indices of diversity and representation. As such, quantifying composition of DEI structures can provide tangible evidence on potential biases and a base for action to rectify such biases. In this project, we will focus on a pre-determined sample of international learned societies in the fields of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from an earlier project.  

## 🏹 Aims and approach  
This project aims to  evaluate types and sizes of DEI structures and assess potential biases in the lists of members and leaders of these DEI structures. We will conduct a survey of a sample of international learned societies in the fields of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology with publicly available information on DEI structures. Our findings will be openly available and disseminated in the research community.      

## 🪓 Impact  
We expect that our findings will contribute to culture change fostering more equitable and open science.    

## 💎 Team  
We have an diverse and open team of early- and mid-career researchers who will be contributing to this project. The project has just started and we still accept new contributors from traditionally underrepresented and marginalised groups in research.

## 💛 Contributing  
Overall, when you work with us:   
- We welcome researchers with all backgrounds and walks of life o contribute to this project.   
- You do not need any special research skills - just attention to detail, Internet access and some time available.   
- You will need to fill in the Expression Of Interest (EOI) form to provide us with your details. If you would like to join us and are from traditionally underrepresented and marginalised groups in research, please let get in touch with the project leads for the link to the EOI form.   
- We already had an initial virtual hackathon (information and feedback meeting) in October 2024, but we can schedule additional virtual meetings if you feel like you would like to chat with the leaders or other project participants. Send your suggestions!  
- We will do all the work asynchronously online until we complete all tasks of the project.    
- For more details on how to contribute and how we deal with recognising everybodys contributions see our full [CONTRIBUTION GUIDE](/CONTRIBUTING.md).  
- We expect all project contributors to familiarise themselves and follow our [CODE OF CONDUCT](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).   
- If you would like to comment on this project or provide suggestions to improve it, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or reach directly to us via email or a dedicated SORTEE (the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, www.sortee.org) Slack channel (join SORTEE and get invited to their Slack workspace, then join channel #conf2024-h05-diversity-of-dei-committees-across-international-learned-societies.
- Our main way of communicating is via emails and comments on shared Google Docs (used for data collection). We will email specific contributing instructions to the project participants, for the project tasks they sign up to.
- We will provide clarifications and answer questions via email and dedicated Slack channel, as needed (so get in touch when you need help or explanations). Please let us know when you are stuck or you do not have time to finish a given task, so we can find replacement and keep moving forward. 
- We periodically send you updates on the project progress. 
- All contributions to this project are voluntary. We will not proide financial renumaration for any contributions (we have no dedicated funding).
- You can withdraw from the project at any time.
