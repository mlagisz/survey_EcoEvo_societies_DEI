# CONTRIBUTION GUIDE    


**Our mission statement:** *Making science more equitable and open.* 🌟  


## 💛  Contributing 
   
**General:**
- We welcome researchers with all backgrounds and walks of life to contribute to this project.   
- You do not need any special research skills - just attention to detail, Internet access and some time available.   
- You will need to fill in the Expression Of Interest (EOI) form to provide us with your details. If you would like to join us and are from traditionally underrepresented and marginalised groups in research, please let get in touch with the project leads for the link to the EOI form.   
- We already had an initial virtual hackathon (information and feedback meeting) in October 2024, but we can schedule additional virtual meetings if you feel like you would like to chat with the leaders or other project participants. Send your suggestions!  
- We will do all the work asynchronously online until we complete all tasks of the project.    
- For more details on how to contribute and how we deal with recognising everybodys contributions.  
- We expect all project contributors to familiarise themselves and follow our [CODE OF CONDUCT](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).   
- If you would like to comment on this project or provide suggestions to improve it, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or reach directly to us via email or a dedicated SORTEE (the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, www.sortee.org) Slack channel (join SORTEE and get invited to their Slack workspace, then join channel #conf2024-h05-diversity-of-dei-committees-across-international-learned-societies).
- Our main way of communicating is via emails and comments on shared Google Docs (used for data collection). We will email specific contributing instructions to the project participants, for the project tasks they sign up to.
- We will provide clarifications and answer questions via email and dedicated Slack channel, as needed (so get in touch when you need help or explanations). Please let us know when you are stuck or you do not have time to finish a given task, so we can find replacement and keep moving forward. 
- We periodically send you updates on the project progress. 
- All contributions to this project are voluntary. We will not proide financial renumaration for any contributions (we have no dedicated funding).
- You can withdraw from the project at any time.

## 💝  Acknowledgement of contributions   
All project participants who contributed any amount of work, and provided their details, will be acknowledged as project contributors on the project page, report, presentations, and manuscript. We will mainly use a CRediT-like statement format, but we will also keep a more detailed record of individual contributions to specific tasks within the stages of the project. This record will be also made publicly available as part of the open project materials (as a publicly available dataset and  within the final report). You can request to have your details removed or obscured at any time.    

## 📄 Co-authorship  
Project participants with substantial and high-quality contributions (as defined below) will become co-authors of the manuscript. They will contribute to any or all of these: data extraction, checking, analyses and/or report drafting.   

Substantial contributions could be achieved by performing the tasks listed below:  
- completing extraction of data for the assigned set of the learned societies (the number will depend on the number of available contributors on the team).     
 
Additional contributions that will count towards determining authorship order on the manuscript (for groups of contributors with equal level of contributions we will assign random order, but additional tasks will move you forward):    

- providing feedback on the protocol, draft report, or final report.    
- extracting much more data than other contributors, e.g. picking up extractions abandoned/missed by another contributor.  
- cross-checking or fixing data extracted by other contributors.  
- cross-checking or fixing analysis code.  
- contributing to the analyses.  
- suggesting relevant references to be cited in the report.  
- suggesting relevant reviewers for the manuscript.  

We note that additional contribution opportunities may be available via data cleaning, analyses, visualisations, and writing, as needed, and at the discretion of the project leads.   

IMPORTANT: Authorship is also conditional on reading and approving the final manuscript draft before submission and providing all personal information (name, affiliation, email, ORCID, etc.) needed for the submission.     


REITERATING: In the manuscript, first and last authorship positions will be reserved to the project leads (they could be co-first and co-last positions). Subsequent authorship positions will be determined by the total amount and quality of contributions, as in the project records. For equal contributions the order of mid-authorship will be random. All authors must read and approve the final manuscript draft before submission. The manuscript will contain a CRediT-like statement detailing the roles of individual authors and contributors.   


## 📍 Final notes   
Project leads reserve the right to interpret and change the contribution rules at any time, if such need arises. In case of any disputes decisions of the project leads will be final.
